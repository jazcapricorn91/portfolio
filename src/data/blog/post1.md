# Hi there!

So I guess this is my **first** official blog post. Just like any good developer, I start with a Hello, World.
I never was into the Live Journaling thing, or religiously updating my Twitter or Facebook so don't expect much other than updates on new projects being started or finished.
My interest has always been more about doing than reflecting. I paint, draw, do photography and make websites and am starting to venture into programming.
If anything catches your eye, let me know. I'll be happy to chat!

Right now I am currently working on a fulltime project, so I borrowed the wonderful template until I have time to design my own portfolio.
Expect some amazing things and links to my completed and current projects.
